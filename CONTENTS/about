The pop-eye is a unique online platform offering contemporary and relevant entertainment education video content. It features content curated by ACEE The Third Eye, addressing the imminent issues of our time, such as health, environment, human rights, gender, sustainable development etc. 
The idea is to offer anyone access to fundamentally entertaining and enriching content that addresses the aforementioned issues. Considering that internet access in rural areas that are even bereft of television and electricity is growing at an ever rapid pace, the pop-eye aims to reach out to these communities with a spectrum of content that would empower their lives through education and direct action. 
The platform however, is not solely limited to media dark communities. The pop-eye library will continue to grow across all genres, styles and forms offering entertaining as well as enriching content to a vast spectrum of audiences. The platform thus aspires to find its place as not only a place of entertainment, but a tool of education, communication, empowerment, guidance and action. 
All featured content guarantees photorealistic portrayals that are accurate to the real world as well as content that advocates, encourages, nurtures and enables positive changes in attitude and behavior for audiences.
